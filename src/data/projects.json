            "This project provided me with great insight into the <strong>full website development process</strong>. The process was challenging since it involved many practices I had no experience with, such as content writing and <strong>layout design</strong>. I also faced many development issues as I tried to integrate technologies I hadn’t worked with before. This was also a greater scale project than I was used to working on, so keeping an organized file structure was difficult. However, these difficulties greatly added to my web development learning experience.",
            "In case you’re curious, the <strong>steps</strong> I followed were: decide on website content to host, create/write this content, decide on the website's general architecture, sketch low-fidelity wireframes, design high-fidelity prototypes with <strong>Adobe XD</strong>, decide what technologies to build with, and develop the website.",
            "On the programming side, I chose to build this site with <strong>React</strong> since I wanted to gain more experience with it and was also curious about using <strong>React Router</strong> to simulate multi-page navigation. To handle my contact form’s submission, I used the <strong>Formspree API</strong> along with the react-hook-form library to help with form validation. I also used <strong>Framer Motion</strong> and react-intersection-observer to implement some simple animations as an element was rendered or scrolled by. Most other functionalities were simply handled with <strong>useState</strong> and <strong>useEffect</strong>, like the mobile menu and slider within each project page.", 
            "Lastly, I built this website to be <strong>fully responsive</strong> starting with a <strong>mobile-first</strong> approach and used <strong>Sass partials</strong> to keep my styles organized and modular."
